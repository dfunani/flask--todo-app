Interview Assignment

Welcome
Welcome to Retail Capital. This assignment will give you a taste of working at Retail Capital (the tech stack, at least). We’re not imposing
particular time limits on it but it shouldn’t take more than a few hours (please try to complete it under 4 hours - you can use more time at
your own discretion to improve the submission but it doesn’t have to be absolutely perfect - think of it as a demonstration of your abilities
and thinking rather than an exercise in writing bug-free code, but obviously, it should work). Your submission will be assessed, after which
time you may be invited to an interview with some of the dev team.

Overview
Your task is to design 2 applications that make up a to-do web application

What You Need to Do
1. Both applications must be in Flask
2. Both applications must be dockerised
3. The front-end application must render templates in Jinja
4. The database must be PostgreSQL
5. Create a few automated tests just to demonstrate the capacity to write them - you do not need to aim for test coverage here and you can
add them to either application (or both). Be sure to include at least one unit test and one integration test.
6. Ensure that everything required to install and run your application is outlined in the README

The Details that Matter
1. Proper use of RESTful API’s is important - the data, the processing of data and response are all important
2. Proper error handling is important - this can occur at any stage in the application
3. Code organisation is important - it should be clear to read
4. Be able to talk about what you thought you implemented well and why as well as what you think could be improved and why.

Submitting Your Assignment
Add your assignment to a GitHub repo that we are able to clone and run locally and submit that repo to the recruitment channel to be
passed on to us.
